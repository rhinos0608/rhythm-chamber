  "description": "Rhythm Chamber is an AI-powered data analytics application that focuses on what your data says about you—think Spotify Wrapped but year-round and actually personalized. Bring your own intelligence: run local models or your own keys, with demo mode and template-driven profile synthesis for instant exploration. Upload your JSON/ZIP export or connect Spotify for quick snapshots. The app is 100% client-side; only your chosen AI provider and music service see your data.",
