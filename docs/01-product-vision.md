# Product Vision

## The Insight

**Spotify Wrapped works because it tells people who they ARE:**
- "You're in the top 1% of Radiohead listeners" → identity badge
- "You're a Tastemaker" → personality trait

People don't care about the numbers. They care about **what the numbers say about who they are.**

---

## The Product

**Wrapped, but:**
- Year-round / on-demand
- Conversational (you can ask "why?")
- Psychological depth (what does this say about ME?)
- Based on actual behavioral data, not just play counts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core positioning:** We don't show you stats. We hold up a mirror.

## First Insight Example

**Not this:**
> "You've listened to 12,847 hours since 2016"

**This:**
> 🎵 Your Music Personality: "The Emotional Archaeologist"
>
> You don't just listen to music — you use it to process feelings.
> Your patterns show distinct "emotional eras":
> - Spring 2020: Heavy rotation of sad songs (grief processing)
> - Summer 2022: Explosion of new artists (rebuilding phase)
>
> You mark time through sound. Want to explore what each era meant?
