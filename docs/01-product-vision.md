# Product Vision

## The Insight

**Chat with your Spotify data—the way ChatGPT can't.**

Your complete listening history is too big for ChatGPT. We handle it locally, with privacy, semantic search, and accurate data queries. Upload your Spotify export and ask questions like:

- "What was I listening to during my breakup in March?"
- "How did my taste change after college?"
- "When did I stop listening to The National, and why?"

Plus: Get your listener personality type based on actual patterns in your data.

## The Product

**Chat-first analysis, not charts:**
- Natural language queries ("What was I like in 2019?")
- Semantic search across your entire history
- Personality types based on behavioral patterns, not play counts
- Zero-backend architecture—your data never leaves your device

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core positioning:** We don't show you stats. We help you understand yourself.

## Music Personality Types

| Type | Description | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Emotional Archaeologist** | Uses music to process past events | Distinct eras, high repeat, sudden shifts |
| **Mood Engineer** | Strategically uses music to change state | Morning vs evening patterns, mood searching |
| **Discovery Junkie** | Constantly seeking new artists | High unique count, low plays-per-artist |
| **Comfort Curator** | Small rotation of beloved songs | Same 200 songs for years, slow change |
| **Social Chameleon** | Listening shifts by context | Weekday ≠ weekend patterns |

**Not Myers-Briggs.** These compete with stats.fm's generic charts by telling you *who you are* through your music.

## First Insight Example

**Stats.fm shows:**
> "You listened to 12,847 hours since 2016"

**Rhythm Chamber shows:**
> 🎵 Your Music Personality: "The Emotional Archaeologist"
>
> You don't just listen to music—you use it to process feelings.
> Your patterns show distinct "emotional eras":
> - Spring 2020: Heavy rotation of sad songs (grief processing)
> - Summer 2022: Explosion of new artists (rebuilding phase)
>
> You mark time through sound. Want to explore what each era meant?

## Competitive Position

| Stats.fm | Rhythm Chamber |
|----------|----------------|
| **WHAT** | **WHY & WHO** |
| "You listened to X hours" | "You're a Mood Engineer because..." |
| Charts & graphs | Identity & meaning |
| Full history + real-time | Full history only |
| Low technical barrier (OAuth) | Medium (file upload OR OAuth) |
| Click to explore | Ask questions naturally |

**We're not competing for stats nerds.** We're competing for everyone who screenshots Wrapped and wants deeper self-understanding.

## The BYOK Advantage

**Bring Your Own Keys—this is a feature, not a bug:**

Power users WANT control:
- **Privacy-conscious**: Already exporting data, understand data sovereignty
- **Technical**: Know what API keys are, appreciate transparency
- **Sovereignty**: Willing to pay for their own infrastructure
- **No black box**: They control the AI, we provide the interface

**Zero-backend architecture is our moat:**
- Stats.fm needs servers → must monetize → controls your data
- Rhythm Chamber: "Your data never leaves your device, runs in your browser, you control everything"

For the quantified-self crowd, this is hugely compelling.

## Monetization

| Tier | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Personality reveal, unlimited chat (free models), local processing |
| **Premium** | $2/month or $10 lifetime | Cloud sync (optional), priority support, premium models |

### Why This Works
- **Transparent**: Users only pay for what we pay for
- **Respects power users**: BYOK model appeals to privacy-conscious
- **Zero infrastructure costs**: Free tier is actually free
- **Viral loop**: Shareable personality cards drive signups

---

## Target Audience

**Old framing:** Stats nerds who export data (~5M)

**New framing:** Everyone who screenshots Wrapped (~100M+) + quantified-self enthusiasts

The data export friction is real, but the payoff is self-discovery, not just stats.
