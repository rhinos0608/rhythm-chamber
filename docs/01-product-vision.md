# Product Vision

## The Insight

**Spotify Wrapped works because it tells people who they ARE:**
- "You're in the top 1% of Radiohead listeners" → identity badge
- "You're a Tastemaker" → personality trait

People don't care about the numbers. They care about **what the numbers say about who they are.**

---

## The Product

**Wrapped, but:**
- Year-round / on-demand
- Conversational (you can ask "why?")
- Psychological depth (what does this say about ME?)
- Based on actual behavioral data, not just play counts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core positioning:** We don't show you stats. We hold up a mirror.

## Music Personality Types

| Type | Description | Signals |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Emotional Archaeologist** | Uses music to process past events | High repeat of era-specific songs, sudden shifts |
| **Mood Engineer** | Strategically uses music to change state | Distinct morning/evening patterns |
| **Discovery Junkie** | Constantly seeking new artists | High unique count, low plays-per-artist |
| **Comfort Curator** | Small rotation of beloved songs | Same 200 songs for years |
| **Social Chameleon** | Listening shifts by context | Weekday ≠ weekend patterns |

## First Insight Example

**Not this:**
> "You've listened to 12,847 hours since 2016"

**This:**
> 🎵 Your Music Personality: "The Emotional Archaeologist"
>
> You don't just listen to music — you use it to process feelings.
> Your patterns show distinct "emotional eras":
> - Spring 2020: Heavy rotation of sad songs (grief processing)
> - Summer 2022: Explosion of new artists (rebuilding phase)
>
> You mark time through sound. Want to explore what each era meant?

## Competitive Position

| Stats.fm | Rhythm Chamber |
|----------|----------------|
| "Look at your data" | "Look at yourself" |
| Charts & graphs | Identity & meaning |
| Stats nerds | Everyone who loves Wrapped |
| "I listened to X" | "X says I'm Y type of person" |

**We're not competing for the same user.** They want more stats. We offer self-discovery.

## Monetization

| Tier | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Personality type reveal, unlimited chat (free models) |
| **Premium **| $2 Per month or $5 Lifetime | storage and chat synchronization (nothing is feature locked)

### Why This Works
- Nothing is feature locked and users only pay for what we pay for as well
- We are transparent about our data
- People flock to spotify wrapped and stats.fm, we give them a reason to keep coming back
- We only monetize and handle user data on market signal, giving easy MVP

## Target Audience

| Old Framing | New Framing |
|-------------|-------------|
| Stats nerds who export data (~5M) | Everyone who screenshots Wrapped (~100M+) |

The friction is data export, BUT the payoff is much bigger than Wrapped.
