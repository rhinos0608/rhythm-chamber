# User Journey: The Stats.fm Refugee

**Source Channel:** r/spotify, TikTok
**Motivations:** Cost-conscious, loves data but hit a paywall, frustrated with "Import Fees".
**Friction Tolerance:** Low-Medium (Will endure setup to save money).

## The Narrative

"I finally got my full data package from Spotify. It took 2 weeks.
I went to upload it to Stats.fm (Spotistats), and they hit me with the 'Plus' paywall to import the full history.
I mean, it's cheap, but I have 4 subscriptions already.
Then I saw a comment: *'Just use Rhythm Chamber. It's free, open source, and you can actually talk to it.'*"

### 1. The Landing
"I go to the site. It looks minimal.
'Upload Your Data'.
I drag the `my_spotify_data.zip` file I already have on my desktop.
No 'Premium Import' banner. No credit card field.
It just starts working."

### 2. The Hurdle (API Key)
"Then it stops. 'Configure Intelligence'.
It wants an API key.
Ugh. I thought this was free?
I read the fine print: *'We don't sell your data, so we don't pay for the servers. You use your own free key from Google.'*
Okay, fair enough. 'Bring Your Own Booze' but for AI.
I click the link.
I sign in with Google.
I get confused for a second—it asks me to 'Enable Generative Language API'.
I click Enable.
Then 'Create API Key in new project'.
I copy the weird code string."

### 3. Back on Track
"I paste the key.
`System Ready`.
It says 'Indexing...'. A little progress bar fills up.
I'm waiting for the 'Pay $5 to see your top artist' screen.
It never comes."

### 4. The Discovery
"I type: *'Who was my top artist in 2022?'*
AI: *'In 2022, your top artist was **Bad Bunny**, with 4,203 minutes streamed.
However, you were in the top 1% of listeners for **Rosalía**, specifically the album *Motomami* in the spring.'*

Okay, that's what Wrapped told me. Cool.
But then I try something I couldn't do on the other app.
*'Compare my 2022 summer vibe to my 2023 summer vibe.'*

AI: *'Big shift.
**Summer 2022**: heavily reggaeton and upbeat pop (Bad Bunny, Karol G). High energy, party playlists.
**Summer 2023**: You shifted to "Sad Girl" indie. Boygenius, Phoebe Bridgers, and lots of Lana Del Rey.
Your average BPM (beats per minute) dropped from ~110 to ~85. Did something happen in May 2023? That's when the shift started.'*

I stare at the screen.
Yeah, something happened in May 2023.
I broke my leg and was stuck inside for 3 months.
I didn't realize my music slowed down that much."

### 5. The Verdict
"I got the insights I wanted, plus a psychological profile I didn't ask for.
For $0.
The API key setup was annoying (took like 4 minutes), but saving the subscription fee was worth it.
I'm keeping the zip file on my laptop."
