## The Narrative

"I saw a tweet where someone's music app told them they had 'Main Character Syndrome'. I want to see what it says about me.
I go to the site. 'Rhythm Chamber'.
I click 'Demo Mode' first just to see what it does.
It loads a 'Emo Teen' profile.
I ask: 'Am I cool?'
It roasts the demo profile: *'You listened to "Welcome to the Black Parade" 400 times. You are not cool, you are theatrical.'*
Okay, I need to do this with my real data."

### 1. The Realization (The Wait)
"I click 'Upload'.
It says I need my Spotify data.
I click the link to Spotify.
Spotify says: *'We will email you in 5-30 days.'*
30 DAYS?!
I'm bummed. I thought it was instant like Wrapped.
But I request it anyway.
...
*Two weeks later.*
I get the email. 'Your Spotify Data is ready'.
I remember the cool website. I go back."

### 2. The Setup (The Scary Part)
"I upload the zip.
It asks for an API Key.
'Gemini'.
I've used ChatGPT, but I've never done 'API' stuff. Sounds like coding.
The guide says: 'Click here, click Create, Copy, Paste. No credit card.'
I take a breath and try it.
I go to Google. It looks like a developer dashboard. scary.
I see 'Get API Key'.
I click it.
It works. I copy the `AIza...` thing.
I paste it into the website.
It turns Green. 'System Ready'.
I feel like a hacker."

### 3. The "Magic"
"I don't know what to ask.
I type: *'What is my vibe?'*
It replies: *'That's a bit broad! I have history from 2016 to 2024. Want to know about your recent listening, your all-time favorites, or your guilty pleasures?'*
Okay, it's sassy.
I type: *'What are my guilty pleasures?'*

AI: *'I see you present as a Hip Hop fan (Drake, Kendrick are your top artists).
But...
On Sunday mornings between 8 AM and 11 AM, you have a recurring pattern of listening to the **Glee Cast Soundtracks**.
Specifically, you've played "Don't Stop Believin'" (Glee Version) 52 times this year.
You usually skip these tracks if you're listening on a weekday.'*

### 4. The Reaction
"I gasp.
I literally listen to the Glee playlist when I'm cleaning the house on Sundays.
I thought that was buried in the noise.
It noticed the **time of day**.
It noticed I **skip it on weekdays** (when friends are around).
It knows I'm hiding it.

I take a screenshot immediately.
Caption: 'I feel attacked.'
Post to Instagram Stories."

### 5. The Loyalty
"I bookmark the site.
Now I want to know what it thinks about my gym playlist.
It feels like a friend who pays way too much attention."
