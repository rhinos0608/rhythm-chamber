## The Narrative

"A friend sent me the link. Said it was 'better than Last.fm because it understands context'.
I'm skeptical. I've scrobbled since 2012. I know my top artist is Radiohead. I don't need an AI to tell me that."

### 1. The Setup
"I skip the 'Demo Mode'. I want the real data.
I upload my `StreamingHistory.zip`.
It asks for an API key. I groan.
I almost close the tab, but the guide says the Gemini one is free and takes 30 seconds.
Fine.
I get the key, paste it in.
It says `Indexing 45,000 tracks...`.
Okay, that's a lot of data. It takes a solid minute. I grab a coffee."

### 2. The First Test (The "Vibe" Check)
"I decide to test its knowledge. I don't want stats; I want *interpretation*.
I type:
*'Analyze my "Sad Dad" era. When did it start and who were the main characters?'*'

It pauses.
Then it hits me:
*'Your "Sad Dad" era appears to have begun in **February 2018**.
Prior to this, you were heavy on Garage Rock (Ty Segall, Thee Oh Sees).
In Feb 2018, you abruptly started streaming **The National** ("Sleep Well Beast") and **Wilco** ("Yankee Hotel Foxtrot").
The peak was **July 2018**, where you listened to "Pink Rabbits" 87 times.
Interestingly, you also started listening to a lot of **Steely Dan** around this time, suggesting an embrace of high-fidelity production alongside the melancholy.'*

I laugh out loud. 'Pink Rabbits' 87 times. I remember that summer. And the Steely Dan callout is painfully accurate."

### 3. The Deep Dive
"I want to know about a specific weird phase I had.
*'Why did I stop listening to Black Midi? I loved Schlagenheim.'*

AI:
*'You didn't stop abruptly, but there was a divergence.
You played *Schlagenheim* heavily (400+ streams) in 2019.
When *Cavalcade* came out in 2021, you gave it 3 full listens on release week, then only visited specific tracks ("John L") sporadically.
Simultaneously, your listening data shows a massive spike in **Ambient** and **New Age** (Laraaji, Brian Eno) during that same month.
It looks like you moved away from chaotic noise rock right as you started seeking sonic texture and calm. You traded math rock for bath rock.'*

'Math rock for bath rock.'
That is a bar. And it's true."

### 4. The Share
"I screenshot that response.
I crop it so it just shows the analysis, not my API key settings.
I post it to the discord.
*'This thing just read me for filth. It knew exactly why I dropped Black Midi.'*
Everyone asks for the link."

### 5. The Value
"Stats.fm tells me I listened to Black Midi 500 times.
Rhythm Chamber told me *why I stopped*.
That's the difference. It feels like talking to a music critic who has been stalking me for a decade."
