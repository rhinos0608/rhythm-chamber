## Core Flow

```
Upload .zip → Personality Reveal → Chat → Share Card
```

## Key Differentiators

1. **Duration tracking** — Music engagement analysis
2. **Personality types** — What kind of type your data shows
3. **Silence as a feature** — Zero-choice, no explanation
4. **100% free** - nothing is feature is locked, future monetization for $2 monthly or $10 lifetime for chat storage and synchronization

## Project Status
🚧 **Pre-development** — Documentation complete, ready for implementation
